His campaign in Nepal helped rescue and rehabilitate more than 12,000 Nepali children working in Indian circuses, embroidery factories and households. The organisation has rescued and rehabilitated about 84,000 children since its establishment.\n\nLater in the day, Satyarthi was felicitated amid a programme in Tulsipur, Dang. Tikaram Regmi, coordinator of the Civil Reception Committee, offered him with Nepali Dhaka topi (cap) and provided a felicitation letter.\n\nAddressing the programme, Satyarthi dedicated the Nobel Prize to all children. He said that he decided to visit Nepal soon after receiving the prize because he shared a special relationship with the people here.\n\n\u201cI have come here to get blessings from the Nepali people,\u201d he said, adding he would achieve success once every child lives a life free from all kind of labours. He also inspected Tulsipur Park and a Dang-based NGO before returning to the Capital.\n\nSatyarthi, who arrived in the Capital on Friday, had also met with Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, Constituent Assembly Chairman Subas Nembang and members of the National Planning Commission and expressed hope that the constitution would be delivered on time and that it would ensure the rights of children.\n\n\u201cThanks to Parliament, prime minister, planning commission and children and people of Nepal for hosting me with overwhelming warmth today,\u201d he tweeted on Friday after the meetings."
