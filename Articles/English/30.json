    "news": "KATHMANDU, DEC 21 - \r\n\tPDCC Chairman Baburam Bhattarai said on Saturday the parties should worry about the contents of the new constitution, not the deadline to promulgate it.\n\nThe statute might be promulgated even after the agreed January 22 date, he said, but the new constitution should address people\u2019s aspirations and the outcomes of the political movements. The senior Maoist leader said there was the risk of leaving out genuine agendas in the rush to meet the deadline.\n\nSpeaking at a programme organised in Bhaktapur, Bhattarai said the conflict was between \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cstatus quoist\u201d forces."
