Retail market and tourism sector is also growing. We provide strong servers, telecommunication systems and security solutions for the corporate sectors. Majority of hotels are using NEC\u2019s products here. For the banks, we have complete non-stop solutions.

Nepal\u2019s IT market is also growing in recent years they can achieve much more things by adapting latest technology and solutions. There are much basic infrastructure is in the process of growing that signals the potential of IT and network servers in Nepal. I have seen that Nepali market changed over the last one decade.
