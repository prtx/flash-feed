    "news": "KATHMANDU, DEC 21 - \r\n\tThe Armed Police Force (APF) and India\u2019s Sasastra Seema Bal (SSB) on Saturday launched hotline telephone number, 1114, to handle complaints against harassments by security personnel and other grievances in both sides of the Nepal-India border. Those who think they are harassed by security personnel at the border can lodge their complaints through the hotline service at the APF headquarters or regional offices, the APF said.\n\nSP Ajay Chatakuli said security personnel from the nearby post will be mobilised once people lodge complaint through the hotline service.\n\nThe APF has also installed 66 signboards informing people about the service and urging them to make a call if they face problems while traveling across the border. Nepalis who come home from India ahead of festivals like Dashain and Tihar often complain of harassment by SSB personnel at the border.\n\n\u201cPeople can dial the number if they come across any problems at the border. APF will look into the cases in Nepali side while SSB will take up the case in India,\u201d he said. In the southern side of the border, the SSB has launched three hotline numbers--180, 034 and 56106--for similar service.\n\nA meeting of APF SSB officials in  Kathmandu  some three weeks ago took the decision on the hotline service. The decision was formalised after APF chief Kosh Raj Onta visited India and held talks on the matter on Friday.\n\nAPF said it will take action against its officials if they are found not cooperating people."
