Earlier, the maximum fare was Rs 19,000 per 10 tonnes.\n\nClaiming that existing fare too low, a meeting of various committees of truckers associated with the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE) held on November 30 had fixed a limit of six trips per month on long routes and 10 trips per month on short routes for a truck so that all trucks could get a chance to operate at higher fares. As a result, truck operators were bound to put their vehicles in garage creating a shortage of vehicles.\n\nSaturday\u2019s meeting was attended by industrialists and representatives of Siddharthanagar Chambers of commerce and Industry.\n\n\u201cThis agreement will ease transpiration of goods to a large extent,\u201d said Bishnu Sharma, president of the chambers. \u201cIf the agreement is not implanted, we will seek the administration\u2019s help for necessary action.\u201d\n\nThe meeting also decided trucks from Dang, Birjung and the eastern region can freely transport goods. Trucks from other regions were not much interested entering  Bhairahawa  as the federation barred loaded trucks from exiting the district without having acquired a \u201ctoken\u201d. \u201cThe federation would even dilly dally issuing the token, while traders were forced to pay more fares,\u201d said Sharma.\n\nAs the syndicate system resulted in a surge in fares, the local administration pressured truck operators to reach a consensus by holding a stakeholders\u2019 meet. According to a source, the fare on the Kathmandu- Bhairahawa  road for Saturday was maintained at Rs 23,000 per 10 tonnes."
