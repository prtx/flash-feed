    "news": "KATHMANDU, DEC 21 - \r\n\tThe  Kathmandu  Metropolitan City (KMC) has planned to landscape Ranipokhari to add attraction to the recently-renovated landmark. Realising the need to preserve and promote the area, the metropolis planned to outfit the area with various decoration and greenery.\n\nThe pond was outfitted recently with musical fountain, which added appeal to the landmark situated in the city centre. Besides this, four other water fountains were also installed at the four corners of Ranipokhari. While the government allocated over Rs 1 million for renovating the landmark before the Saarc Summit, only around Rs 400,000 was used. \u201cHence, we have requested the government to allow us to use the remaining amount for an extensive landscaping,\u201d KMC chief Dhana Bahadur Shrestha said.\n\nThe KMC spent only around Rs 30 million on the musical fountain though the government allocated around Rs 32 million for the same. \u201cWe also want to use the remaining amount for the new project,\u201d Shrestha said. He said they plan to open the area for general public after landscaping it. \u201cWe will charge certain amount for maintenance,\u201d he said. Besides Ranipokhari, the KMC has also planned to redecorate Khullamanch with grass carpeting and greenery. The \u201copen theatre\u201d too was a part of the Saarc beautification project.\n\n"
