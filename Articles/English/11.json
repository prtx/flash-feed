    "news": "KATHMANDU, DEC 21 - \r\n\tSenior leader of CPN-UML,  Jhala Nath Khanal , has requested the alliance of 19 political parties led by UCPN (Maoist) to stop issuing the threats of another agitation. He said that the ruling parties are committed to bring the new constitution by January 22 deadline.\n\n\n\nKhanal urged the opposition parties to stop talking about street protests as the nation has witnessed the Maoists-led decade-long people\u2019s war.\n\n\u201cWe have seen the decade long armed revolt of the Maoists and the Madhes movement,\u201d said Khanal, speaking at an interaction programme at Reporter\u2019s Club in Kathmandu on Sunday. \u201cTherefore, the people are not going to be scared anymore of their baseless threats.\u201d\n\n\n\nKhanal further noted that the UCPN (M) led alliance would not reach anywhere by walking out the talks intended to forge consensus. He said the disputed issues should be resolved through due procedure as nowhere in the world has the constitution been drafted by bringing all the dissenting sides to consensus.\n\n\n\nHe opined that the reports submitted by the Political Dialogue and Consensus Committee (PDCC) to the Constitution Assembly would not be returned to the committee.\n\n\n\nHe warned of retaliation against those who opposing the voting process and expressed his disapproval against dividing the country into worthless states.\n\n\n\nHe also asserted that the Madhes and Hill must not be separated in the name of federalism.\n\n\n\nRecalling how the wrong path adopted by the UCPN (M) led to the failure of previous Constitution Assembly, Khanal requested the party not to repeat the same mistake again."
