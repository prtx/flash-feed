The stench from dead birds pollutes the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cApproximately 5,000 pigeons have died in a week,\u201d said Bharat Shrestha, treasurer of the Bhimeshwor temple prayer and trust management committee.\n\nAuthorities are yet to respond to the situation.

He added that rooftops and areas surrounding the temple had yet to be cleared of dead pigeons."
