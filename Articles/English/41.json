Doctors said the victim had also suffered injuries on her genitals.\n\nParbati said that her husband and her in-laws started abusing her within a few days after the marriage for not bringing sufficient dowry. She said that her family had offered Rs 25,000 cash, a bicycle and a cow as dowry to her husband\u2019s family at the time of the marriage, four years ago.\n\nAccording to the neighbours, Parbati\u2019s her in-laws have also been mistreating her for not being able to bear a baby boy.\n\nParbati, who had been living at her maternal home for most part of the past one and a half years, had returned to her husband\u2019s house after he returned from Punjab, where he had gone to work."
