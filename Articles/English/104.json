The event saw a total of 63 participants racing from 9 am to late in the evening through several rounds of competition. The finals saw Sambhav Swar Sirohiya (of M&S) taking the top spot, followed by Diwesh Bothra (of Franchise India) in second place; Samriddhi Rai (of M &S) came in third.\n\nThe event, which was organised by Round Table Nepal, had M&S as its media partner. And with enthusiastic participation from leading business houses and corporate entities, the event was a thumping success.\n\nKarting is a motorsport that features small, four-wheel vehicles with very minimalistic frames. The karts race on a scaled-down racetrack. The sport of karting is often regarded as a stepping stone to a professional racing career abroad. But despite the fact that go karting, as a sport, has been extremely popular in the West for more than half a century, it has yet to take off in a major way here.\n\nGo-kart racing in Nepal goes back to 2005, when Tiger Karts began its operations in Manamaiju,  Kathmandu . But the track soon closed down, and it was only in 2013 that the Valley got to see another karting circuit, in the form of Go Kart Racing Nepal, Sanepa.\u00a0 The organisers hope that events like this will go a long way in increasing the popularity of the sport in the country.\nPosted on: 2014-12-21 09:09\n\nOther news by POST REPORT\n\nDec 21 2014\n\nDec 21 2014\n\nDec 21 2014\n\nDec 21 2014"
