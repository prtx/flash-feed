His trip is also a prelude to high-level visits from China next year as Nepal marks the 60th year of the establishment of its diplomatic relations with the northern neighbour.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese are celebrating the 60th year of their diplomatic ties with many countries with immense success. Besides, for the first time China has realised the importance of its neighbours. So Wang\u2019s visit will be an important event,\u201d said Madan Regmi, chairman of the China Study Centre.\n\nSenior Foreign Ministry officials said there were feelers coming from Beijing that there could be high-level visits by the Chinese leadership in the next year but the Chinese side has not shared the details. \u201cThey communicate such important decisions only at the last moment due to security and other reasons. But both sides have agreed to celebrate the 60th anniversary with high-level exchanges and events,\u201d said the officials.\n\nChina\u2019s decision to increase its yearly assistance to Nepal is an indication that more Chinese aid will be pouring into Nepal in various sectors."
