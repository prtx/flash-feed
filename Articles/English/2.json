    "news": "KATHMANDU, DEC 21 - \r\n\tFormer Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai and his wife Hisila Yami donated Rs 50,000 to Rakshya Nepal, an organisation which supported Puja Bohara, a victim of rape, during her ordeal.\n\nAn open letter written by Bohara to the Law Minister, Narahari Acharya, was published on Kantipur on December 16. Bohara was drugged and raped by two men in March, 2012, while she was preparing for her School Leaving Certificate exams.\n\nIn December 2012, the Baitadi district court had convicted two rapists and sentenced them to 13 years in prison and slapped a fined of Rs 50,000 each. In April this year, however, the Mahendranagar Appellate Court overturned the decision and acquitted the men.\n\nReiterating the promise he had made to Bohara on Wednesday, a day after the publication of the open letter, Bhattarai assured those present at Rakshya Nepal of his commitment to fight rape.\n\nThe letter created uproar in the nation, as the Criminal Code bill, currently in Parliament for discussion, proposes a reduction in punishment for gang-rape, from additional five years in prison in the Muluki Ain to additional three years."
