    "news": "KATHMANDU, DEC 21 - \r\n\tMinister for Information and Communications  Minendra Rijal  has said consensus on the substance of the constitution could be made within two hours if parties wish to do so.\n\n\n\nInaugurating the 36th General Assembly of the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal (TAAN) here on Sunday, Minister Rijal said, \"The most debated issue of the new constitution, delineation of provinces, has almost come to consensus. Only few provinces are to be agreed upon. However, it will not be a final delineation. No matter what are being debated outside the forms of governance is no more a bone of contention now. If the parties want to move ahead by shunning obstinacy, they could come to consensus within a couple of hours\".\n\n\n\nHe reiterated that there is no alternative but to promulgate a new constitution within the stated time so as to institutionalise all types of changes made so far in the country.\n\n\n\nThe political parties should be cautious to make growing foreign investment meaningful in opening up further avenues for economic development of the country.\n\n\n\nThe Minister called for tourism entrepreneurs to build positive pressure towards promulgating the new constitution in the stated time."
