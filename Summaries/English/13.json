    "summary": "Senior leader of CPN-UML,  Jhala Nath Khanal , has requested the alliance of 19 political parties led by UCPN (Maoist) to stop issuing the threats of another agitation. Khanal urged the opposition parties to stop talking about street protests as the nation has witnessed the Maoists-led decade-long people\u2019s war. Khanal further noted that the UCPN (M) led alliance would not reach anywhere by walking out the talks intended to forge consensus. Recalling how the wrong path adopted by the UCPN (M) led to the failure of previous Constitution Assembly, Khanal requested the party not to repeat the same mistake again. ",
