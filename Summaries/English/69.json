    "summary": "Truck operators agreed to ease the syndicate system after a stakeholder meet here on Saturday agreed to the fare of Rs 22,000-Rs 24,000 per 10 tonnes on the  Bhairahawa -Kathmandu route. Earlier, the maximum fare was Rs 19,000 per 10 tonnes. Claiming that existing fare too low, a meeting of various committees of truckers associated with the Federation of Nepalese National Transport Entrepreneurs (FNNTE) held on November 30 had fixed a limit of six trips per month on long routes and 10 trips per month on short routes for a truck so that all trucks could get a chance to operate at higher fares. According to a source, the fare on the Kathmandu- Bhairahawa  road for Saturday was maintained at Rs 23,000 per 10 tonnes. ",
