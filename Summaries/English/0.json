    "summary": "Former Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai and his wife Hisila Yami donated Rs 50,000 to Rakshya Nepal, an organisation which supported Puja Bohara, a victim of rape, during her ordeal. An open letter written by Bohara to the Law Minister, Narahari Acharya, was published on Kantipur on December 16. Reiterating the promise he had made to Bohara on Wednesday, a day after the publication of the open letter, Bhattarai assured those present at Rakshya Nepal of his commitment to fight rape. The letter created uproar in the nation, as the Criminal Code bill, currently in Parliament for discussion, proposes a reduction in punishment for gang-rape, from additional five years in prison in the Muluki Ain to additional three years.
