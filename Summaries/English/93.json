    "summary": "The United States stands by its assertion that North Korea was to blame, a White House National Security Council (NSC) spokesman said on Saturday, in response to the remarks. President Barack Obama had blamed North Korea for the devastating cyberattack on Sony, which had led to the Hollywood studio cancelling the imminent release of \"The Interview,\" a comedy on the fictional assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. An unnamed spokesman of North Korea's foreign ministry said there would be serious consequences if Washington refused to agree to a joint probe and continued to accuse Pyongyang, according to the North Korean U. In a separate statement on Saturday in response to criticism of its rights record, North Korea vowed to boost its \"nuclear power\" to counter Washington's hostile policy, saying it had become apparent the United States aimed to invade the North under the guise of human rights abuses.
