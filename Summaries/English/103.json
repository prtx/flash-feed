The finals saw Sambhav Swar Sirohiya (of M&S) taking the top spot, followed by Diwesh Bothra (of Franchise India) in second place; Samriddhi Rai (of M &S) came in third. But despite the fact that go karting, as a sport, has been extremely popular in the West for more than half a century, it has yet to take off in a major way here.
