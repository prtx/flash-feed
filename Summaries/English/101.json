    "summary": "The girl, Punathukumai (Shreeti Pradhan), is forced to take on all the household chores, and she is also made to graze the family\u2019s animals, while she herself has to subsist on meagre rations\u2014sometimes even going days without food. But while it may have children as its central characters, the play itself is produced in such a manner that even adult audiences will be draw in by the performance. The well-crafted set design and lighting work exceedingly well to represent the minute details of a Newari settlement, in which most of the play takes place, and the dark alleys of a nearby forest. The other notable performance comes from Anil Subba, who plays multiple characters as a billy goat, a character named Pakacha and a mouse; he seems to have flair for humour, and it\u2019s no surprise that at the end of the play we are left with lasting impressions of Pradhan\u2019s beautiful songs and Subba\u2019s performance (particularly in his role of a rat).
