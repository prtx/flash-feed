    "summary": "Two Nepalis Gobinda Khanal and Basu Rai are among those working alongside Kailash Satyarthi, the 2014 Noble Peace Prize winner and Indian child rights campaigner. Satyarthi was at the bordering town for a campaign \u201cBal Adhikar Yatra\u201d to raise awareness about the rights of children just like Khanal. He travelled with Satyarthi to many countries, advocating child rights, and rescuing young boys and girls, some of them working in factories and hotels, and others living out in the street with no one to look after them. Rai joined school and graduated from Delhi University, all thanks to the support of the child workers who rescued him from the street of Kathmandu and Satyarthi. ",
