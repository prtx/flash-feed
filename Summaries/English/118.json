    "summary": "Every evening, after the daily chores had been performed for yet another tomorrow, men, women and children would sit round the straw mat, pick up any musical instrument they could lay their hands on and start playing the music in any scale they believed was harmonic. But they continued playing every other night, continued singing one song after another, in an attempt to appease the Goddess and soothe themselves. Om had heard about a new flu that had been affecting a good number of kids, and he had been worried the whole day about whether his son suffered from that flu. As long as she could hear those chords Om Dai played, those symphonies they chorused, as long as she could hear the sounds of the bell ringing, she could never go deaf, she believed. ",
