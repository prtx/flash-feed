    "summary": "In absence of clear legal provision,\u00a0 individuals seeking to obtain citizenship certificate through their mother\u2019s name in  Banke  district have been facing a difficult time. As per the data made available by the District Administration Office (DAO), only 13 people were able to obtain citizenship certificates through their mother\u2019s name in the last fiscal year. The Interim Constitution of Nepal (2007), the Citizenship Act of 2006, and a 2011 Supreme Court directive all grant power to Nepali mothers and Nepali fathers to individually recommend\u00a0 for citizenship to their children. Cases become complicated when the mother is a Nepali citizen and the father, despite being a Nepali citizen, does not own a Nepali citizenship certificate,\u201d Sahani added. ",
