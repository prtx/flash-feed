    "summary": "The UCPN (Maoist) walked out of a \u201cdecisive\u201d meeting called on Saturday to seek consensus on the disputed issues of the constitution writing process. The Constituent Assembly rules of procedure provide room for settling contentious issues through vote and prepare a draft of the new constitution but politically the CA cannot move ahead without consensus among the parties, leaders and legal eagles said on Saturday. \u201cThough legal and constitutional provisions suggest some ways out, it is not possible to prepare the draft of the new constitution without support from the parties outside the government,\u201d said the joint-secretary at the Law Ministry who served as the legal advisor in the first CA. In the three-party meeting on Saturday, Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli proposed to the opposition parties that the contentious issues should be decided by a CA vote. ",
